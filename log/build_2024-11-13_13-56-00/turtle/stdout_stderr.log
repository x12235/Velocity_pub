[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findjoint_state_publisher.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "joint_state_publisher", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "joint_state_publisher" with any of the following names:

    joint_state_publisherConfig.cmake
    joint_state_publisher-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "joint_state_publisher" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "joint_state_publisher_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "joint_state_publisher" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
